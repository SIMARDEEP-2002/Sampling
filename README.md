# Sampling Assignment

Various Sampling techniques applied to imbalanced dataset on credit cards fraud and then applying ml models
on each sample to predict accuracy.


## Procedure

### Imbalanced Data Set

* First the imbalanced dataset is converted to balanced data set using smot oversampling.

### Sampling

* Functions for various sampling techniques are written in the code
* Functions to calculate sample size are also written for every sampling technique.

### Applying Ml models and calculating accuracy

* A sample is generated on training data using a technique as defined in functions.
* On every sample 5 ml models are applied and accuracy is calculated


## Result

* Highest accuracy is obtained in Random Forest using sampling 3 technique.
